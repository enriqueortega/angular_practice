# Class LinkedIn/Github Profile Thing

## Description
Welcome to your peer / class challenge!

Remember JSON? Its coming back! The whole class will need to self organize to build a JSON file that contains several pieces of information about each student: - Their Name, - Github Profile Link, - LinkedIn Profile Picture Link

Once that JSON file is built, you and your peer will need to build out an application that gets that JSON file from the server, and then creates User Cells that have the information listed above (with the image showing of course!). The trick is going to be having the GitHub link be an actual link, and having the image actually display (NOTE: THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT STRAIGHT FORWARD IN ANGULAR. You and your peer will need to research how to display images using Angular. Note that there is a special directive. Once you have the answer, feel free to share that information with the rest of the class).

POST will not be needed for this application. So to get the information, simply define a GET function and call it when your controller loads. The tricky part of this application of course, is getting the information data bound and appearing on the DOM with NG-REPEAT.
